# Weapon Detection with YOLOv8 for Security Cameras

This repository showcases the implementation of YOLOv8, a powerful object detection model, specifically tailored for enhancing security camera systems by accurately detecting weapons such as pistols and knives in surveillance footage. The workflow encompasses several key steps:

1. **Installation and Setup**: Begin by installing essential Python packages, including `ultralytics`, which integrates YOLOv8 seamlessly into your environment.

2. **Object Detection**: Employ YOLOv8 to perform robust object detection tasks on both video and image data from security cameras. The model excels in identifying various objects of interest, crucial for ensuring security.

3. **Segmentation and Classification**: Beyond basic object detection, explore additional capabilities such as segmentation and classification, leveraging the versatility of YOLOv8 for comprehensive security analytics.

4. **Fine-Tuning**: Recognizing the specific challenge of accurately detecting weapons, particularly pistols and knives, with a generic pretrained model, this repository demonstrates how to fine-tune YOLOv8 using a custom dataset. This process enhances the model's ability to detect weapons effectively in diverse real-world scenarios.

5. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the fine-tuned YOLOv8 model by evaluating its predictions against a dedicated test dataset. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to provide quantitative insights into the model's effectiveness in weapon detection.

6. **Validation Results**: Visualize and analyze successful instances of weapon detection from the validation dataset. These examples highlight the model's capability to accurately identify threats and objects of interest in security camera footage.

Through these efforts, this repository aims to empower security professionals and researchers with an advanced toolset for enhancing surveillance capabilities and ensuring robust security measures using state-of-the-art object detection techniques with YOLOv8.
