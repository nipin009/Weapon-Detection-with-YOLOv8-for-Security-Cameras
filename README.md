# Weapon-Detection-with-YOLOv8-for-Security-Cameras
We demonstrate YOLOv8 for detecting weapons in security footage, fine-tuning with custom datasets and adding pretrained classes. Key metrics (recall, F1 score, precision) ensure effectiveness, prioritizing minimizing false negatives to avoid missing threats, even with some false positives.
